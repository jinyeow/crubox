# Crubox

Crystal Utility Toolbox.

A bunch of help scripts and snippets that are too small for their own
project, but need somewhere to live.

May include:
  * algorithms
  * scripts
  * useful classes/modules

## Installation

```
$ # clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/jinyeow/crubox
$
$ # create bin/ directory if it doesn't exist
$ mkdir bin
$
$ # run tests
$ crystal spec
$
$ # if tests pass
$ make
$
```

All the tools should be available in the `bin` directory.

Just copy them into your $PATH to use them.

## Usage
